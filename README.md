#Personal Website Re-Design

Quick website build using the Pelican static site engine.

Things I need it to do:
* Tell people my name
* Tell people what I do professionally
* Tell people how to reach me:
  * Email
  * Social Media
  * Github
* Host anything I happen to write
* Link to projects i've done

Things I need it to do (technical):
* Render notebooks to articles as painlessly as possible
* Keep things organized
* Look fine on mobile
* Run fast
